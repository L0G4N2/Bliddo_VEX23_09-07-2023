This is the C++ code for the Sinister 6.

The robot has a 4-Motor Drivetrain, a catapult, and an Inertial Sensor that is used for auton.

There will be more updates as the season progresses.

Auton Right: Robot starts on the right of the *Elevation Bar*, catapults a *Pre-Load* into the *Defensive Zone*, pushes a *Triball* over the *Bar*, then rearranges itself to face the *Line*.

Auton Skills: *Inspired from previous code that was made in the summer of 2023*.
